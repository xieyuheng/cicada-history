I am designing a prototype programming language.
I have not implemented it yet, and I know the design can never be perfect.
I tried very hard to make the design consistent, and clearly expressing what's in my mind.
I have committed too much to this project.
I am hoping to get a second opinion from an expert.
If it is a failure, I hope I can fail faster.
