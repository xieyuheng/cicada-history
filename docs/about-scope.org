    we need a theory of scope
    note that
    1. during cut, an arrow can be applied separately
    2. during exe, an arrow can be applied with the body

    we might drop the use of hypo in cicada-language

    because cicada-prover will be a different implementation
    based on logic programming language tech

    at least,
    we must be clear about the difference
    between cicada-language and cicada-prover

    I think we are so confused now
    because we are not sure which tech solution
    is used to solve which imp problem
    we are using hypo
    seems it is solving two problems :
    1. a variable has both type and value
    2. a variable might exist after the function exit

    oh we must examine this by examples
