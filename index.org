#+title: Project Proposal

* intro

  - I am designing a prototype programming language.
    I have not implemented it yet, and I know the design can never be perfect.
    I tried very hard to make the design consistent, and clearly expressing what's in my mind.
    I have committed too much to this project.
    I am hoping to get a second opinion from an expert.
    If it will be a failure, I hope I can fail faster.
