#+title: Project Proposal

* Status

  - I am designing a programming language prototype.

  - I tried very hard to make the design consistent,
    and clearly expressing what's in my mind,
    but I know the design can never be perfect.

  - I have committed too much to this project.
    I am hoping to get a second opinion.
    If it will be a failure, I only wish I can fail now.

* Tabel of Content

  - [[./prelude.html][prelude]] -- Basic mathematical structures.
  - [[./sexp-syntax.html][sexp-syntax]] -- Sexp as intermedium syntax.
  - [[./todo.html][todo]] -- Todo list.
  - [[./topics.html][topics]] -- Other topics to be formalized.
