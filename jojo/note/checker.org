  - Coherence in Chalk by Sunjay Varma - Bay Area Rust Meetup

* lowering

  - trans program to logic programming language -- facts and rules
    after lowering one can do query about program

* not only error messages

  - when something goes wrong
    we can not only print error messages
    we can also open a query interface

  - and this query interface is useful
    even when everything is ok
    it can help us understand our program
