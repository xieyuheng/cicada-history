#+title: Postfix Notation

* [todo-stack]

*** about the story -- others's say about De Bruijn Notation

* [note]

  - To use postfix notation in a simple way,
    we must maintain the implicit equivalence
    between `(-- -> a)` and `a`.

  - Due to this implicitness,
    I only embed the postfix notation in prefix notation.
    Just to tell a story.
